# Vintage Apple Develop Magazine Library

Source: <https://vintageapple.org/develop/>

> Ron R. was generous enough to share his PDF libary of Apple's [Develop magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Develop_(Apple_magazine)). The native PDF version of the library came as each article in a separate PDF file, so Ron wrote some Applescript to assemble it into a magazine PDF format with the articles in proper order.

> _Some interesting tidbits_
> - The first four issues continue page numbering from the end of one issue to the next
> - For the first four issues, they dated them by year and month. For issues 5-9, they
dated them by year and season. With the 10th issue, they went back to year / month.
